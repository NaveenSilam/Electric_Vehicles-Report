## ⚙️ Data Preparation
- Downloaded the raw EV sales dataset from Kaggle and imported it into Power BI Power Query.
- Checked for missing values and cleaned or removed incomplete records.
- Standardized state names, vehicle categories, and date formats to ensure consistency.
- Converted the date column into proper Power BI date format and created additional fields like Year, Month, and Day.
- Removed duplicate entries to maintain clean and accurate data.
- Categorized vehicles into groups such as 2-Wheelers, 3-Wheelers, 4-Wheelers, Bus, and Others.
- Loaded the cleaned dataset into Power BI for modelling and dashboard development
- Created new calculated columns and DAX measures for total sales, monthly trends, category distribution, and growth metrics (MoM, YoY).
